# Crypto Tracker App

A small-scale app I developed using technologies that were suggested to me by the good people at Lloyds Digital during my time as an intern.

I was preoccupied with mobile developer tasks and used technologies such as React Native, TypeScript, MobX-State-Tree, React Query and others. Unfortunately, the last two weeks of my internship my mentor had to be at a different workplace so I didn't get a necessary code review during my most critical time of writing code. What kept me going was the fact my child works but I'm hoping I can upgrade it in the near future with new information I learned.
